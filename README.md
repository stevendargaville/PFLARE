# PFLARE library
### Author: Steven Dargaville

This library contains methods which can be used to solve linear systems in parallel with PETSc, with interfaces in C/Fortran/Python. 

It aims to provide fast & scalable iterative methods for asymmetric linear systems, in parallel and on both CPUs and GPUs.
   
Some examples of linear systems that PFLARE can scalably solve include:   
1) Hyperbolic problems such as:
   - Advection equations
   - Streaming operators from Boltzmann transport applications
   - Multigrid in time discretisations
   
   without requiring Gauss-Seidel methods. This includes time dependent or independent equations, with structured or unstructured grids, with lower triangular structure or without.
2) Asymmetric problems such as:
   - Heavily anisotropic Poisson/diffusion equations
3) Symmetric problems such as:
   - Poisson/diffusion equations

## Methods available in PETSC through PFLARE

Installing and using PFLARE adds new methods to PETSc, including:
1) Various polynomial approximate inverses, e.g., GMRES polynomials and Neumann polynomials
2) Reduction multigrids, e.g., AIRG, nAIR and lAIR
3) CF splittings, e.g., PMISR DDC

Details for each are given below, please also see references [1-6]. 

Note: for methods with GPU setup labelled "No" in the tables below, this indicates that some/all of the setup occurs on the CPU before being transferred to the GPU. The setup for these methods may therefore be slow. The solves however all occur on the GPU.   

### PCPFLAREINV - A new PETSc PC type

PCPFLAREINV contains methods for computing approximate inverses, most of which can be applied as assembled matrices or matrix-free. PCPFLAREINV can be used with the command line argument ``-pc_type pflareinv``, with several different PFLAREINV types available with ``-pc_pflareinv_type``:

   | Command line type  | Flag | Description | GPU setup |
   | ------------- | -- | ------------- | -- |
   | power  |  PFLAREINV_POWER  | GMRES polynomial with the power basis  | Yes |
   | arnoldi  |  PFLAREINV_ARNOLDI  | GMRES polynomial with the Arnoldi basis  | Yes |
   | newton  |  PFLAREINV_NEWTON  | GMRES polynomial with the Newton basis with extra roots for stability  | Yes |
   | newton_no_extra  |  PFLAREINV_NEWTON_NO_EXTRA  | GMRES polynomial with the Newton basis with no extra roots   | Yes |
   | neumann  |  PFLAREINV_NEUMANN  | Neumann polynomial  | Yes |
   | sai  |  PFLAREINV_SAI  | Sparse approximate inverse  | No |
   | isai  |  PFLAREINV_ISAI  | Incomplete sparse approximate inverse (equivalent to a one-level RAS)  | No |
   | wjacobi  |  PFLAREINV_WJACOBI  | Weighted Jacobi  | Yes |
   | jacobi  |  PFLAREINV_JACOBI  | Jacobi  | Yes |

### PCAIR - A new PETSc PC type

PCAIR contains different types of reduction multigrids. PCAIR can be used with the command line argument ``-pc_type air``. The combination of ``-pc_air_z_type`` and ``-pc_air_inverse_type`` (given by the PCPFLAREINV types above) defines several different reduction multigrids:

   | ``-pc_air_z_type``  | ``-pc_air_inverse_type`` | Description | GPU setup |
   | ------------- | -- | ------------- | --- |
   | product  |  power, arnoldi or newton  | AIRG  | Yes |
   | product  |  neumann  | nAIR with Neumann smoothing  | Yes |
   | product  |  sai  | SAI reduction multigrid  | No |
   | product  |  isai  | ISAI reduction multigrid  | No |
   | product  |  wjacobi or jacobi  | Distance 0 reduction multigrid  | Yes |
   | lair  |  wjacobi or jacobi  | lAIR  | No |
   | lair_sai  |  wjacobi or jacobi  | SAI version of lAIR  | No |

Different combinations of these types can also be used, e.g., ``-pc_air_z_type lair -pc_air_inverse_type power`` uses a lAIR grid transfer operator and GMRES polynomial smoothing with the power basis.

There are several features used to improve the parallel performance of PCAIR:

   - The number of active MPI ranks on lower levels can be reduced where necessary. If this is used then:
     - Repartitioning with graph partitioners can be applied.
     - OpenMP can be used in the polynomial inverse assembly (i.e., AIRG or nAIR) to reduce setup time (without requiring support for non-busy waits in the MPI library).
     - Calculation of polynomial coefficients can be done on subcommunicators.
   - The PCPFLAREINV methods above can be used as parallel coarse grid solvers, allowing heavy truncation of the multigrid hierarchy.
   - The multigrid hierarchy can be automatically truncated depending on the quality of the coarse grid solver
   - The sparsity of the multigrid hierarchy (and hence the CF splitting, repartitioning and symbolic matrix-matrix products) can be reused during setup.    

### CF splittings

The CF splittings in PFLARE are used within PCAIR to form the multigrid hierarchy. They can also be called independently from PCAIR. The CF splitting type within PCAIR can be specified with ``-pc_air_cf_splitting_type``: 

   | Command line type  | Flag | Description | GPU setup |
   | ------------- | -- | ------------- | -- |
   | pmisr_ddc  |  CF_PMISR_DDC  | Two-pass splitting giving diagonally dominant $\mathbf{A}_\textrm{ff}$ | Yes |
   | pmis  |  CF_PMIS  | PMIS method with symmetrized strength matrix | Yes |
   | pmis_dist2  |  CF_PMIS_DIST2  | Distance 2 PMIS method with strength matrix formed by S'S + S and then symmetrized | Partial |
   | agg  |  CF_AGG  | Aggregation method with root-nodes as C points. In parallel this is processor local aggregation  | No |
   | pmis_agg  |  CF_PMIS_AGG  | PMIS method with symmetrized strength matrix on boundary nodes, then processor local aggregation.  | Partial |

## Building PFLARE

This library depends on MPI, BLAS, LAPACK and PETSc (3.15 to 3.22) configured with a graph partitioner (e.g., ParMETIS). 

Please compile PETSc directly from the source code, as PFLARE requires access to some of the PETSc types only available in the source. We would recommend configuring PETSc with Kokkos if you wish to run on GPUs.

PFLARE has been tested with GNU, Intel, LLVM, NVIDIA and Cray compilers. PFLARE uses the same compilers and flags defined in the PETSc configure.

To build the PFLARE library:

1) Set `PETSC_DIR` and `PETSC_ARCH` environmental variables.
2) Call ``make`` in the top level directory to build the PFLARE library.

Then if desired:

3) Call ``make tests`` in the top level directory to check the build worked with some simple tests.

Then if desired, build and test the Python interface:

4) Call ``make python`` in the top level directory to build the Python module.
5) Call ``make tests_python`` in the top level directory to check the Python build worked with some simple Python tests.  

An up to date Docker image is also available on Dockerhub which includes a build of PFLARE along with all dependencies. To download this Docker image and run the tests use:

     docker run -it stevendargaville/pflare
     make tests

## Linking to PFLARE

For Fortran/C:

1) Link the library `libpflare` to your application; it is output to `lib/`
2) For Fortran: add `include/finclude/` to your include path
3) For C: add `include/` to your include path

For Python:

1) Ensure the full path to `python/` is in your `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable along with the path for PETSc. 
2) `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must include the `lib/` directory (along with paths for PETSc, BLAS and LAPACK).

## Modifying existing code to use PFLARE

After linking your application to the PFLARE library, using the components of PFLARE through PETSc is very simple. 

For Fortran/C, the user must call a single function which registers the new PC types with PETSc, while in Python this is handled by the import statement. For example, the only modifications required in an existing code are:

in Fortran:

     #include "finclude/pflare.h"
     ...
     call PCRegister_PFLARE()
     ...

or in C:

     #include "pflare.h"
     ...
     PCRegister_PFLARE();
     ...

or in Python with petsc4py:

     import pflare
     ...

## Using PFLARE

Once the new PC types have been registered they can then be used like native PETSc types, either by writing code to set the PETSc type/options, or through command line arguments. A few examples include:

#### 1) Using PCAIR with default options, namely AIRG with parameters tuned for a time independent advection equation on 2D unstructured triangles:

in Fortran:

     call KSPGetPC(ksp, pc, ierr)
     call PCSetType(pc, PCAIR, ierr)

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in C:

     ierr = KSPGetPC(ksp, &pc);
     ierr = PCSetType(pc, PCAIR);

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in Python with petsc4py:

     pc = ksp.getPC()
     pc.setType("air")

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]
     
or via the command line: ``-pc_type air``. 

#### 2) Using PCAIR to apply distance 2 lAIR with FFC Weighted Jacobi smoothing:

in Fortran:

     call KSPGetPC(ksp, pc, ierr)
     call PCSetType(pc, PCAIR, ierr)

     call PCAIRSetZType(pc, AIR_Z_LAIR, ierr)
     call PCAIRSetInverseType(pc, PFLAREINV_WJACOBI, ierr)
     call PCAIRSetOneCSmooth(pc, PETSC_TRUE, ierr)

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in C:

     ierr = KSPGetPC(ksp, &pc);
     ierr = PCSetType(pc, PCAIR);

     ierr = PCAIRSetZType(pc, AIR_Z_LAIR);
     ierr = PCAIRSetInverseType(pc, PFLAREINV_WJACOBI);
     ierr = PCAIRSetOneCSmooth(pc, PETSC_TRUE);

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in Python with petsc4py:

     pc = ksp.getPC()
     pc.setType("air")

     petsc_options = PETSc.Options()
     petsc_options['pc_air_z_type'] = 'lair'
     petsc_options['pc_air_inverse_type'] = 'wjacobi'
     petsc_options['pc_air_one_c_smooth'] = ''     

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]
     
or via the command line: ``-pc_type air -pc_air_z_type lair -pc_air_inverse_type wjacobi -pc_air_one_c_smooth``.

#### 3) Using PCFLAREINV to apply a 20th order GMRES polynomial in the Newton basis matrix free:

in Fortran:

     call KSPGetPC(ksp, pc, ierr)
     call PCSetType(pc, PCPFLAREINV, ierr)

     call PCPFLAREINVSetOrder(pc, 20, ierr)
     call PCPFLAREINVSetType(pc, PFLAREINV_NEWTON, ierr)
     call PCPFLAREINVSetMatrixFree(pc, PETSC_TRUE, ierr)

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in C:

     ierr = KSPGetPC(ksp, &pc);
     ierr = PCSetType(pc, PCPFLAREINV);

     ierr = PCPFLAREINVSetOrder(pc, 20);
     ierr = PCPFLAREINVSetType(pc, PFLAREINV_NEWTON);
     ierr = PCPFLAREINVSetMatrixFree(pc, PETSC_TRUE);

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]

or in Python with petsc4py:

     pc = ksp.getPC()
     pc.setType("pflareinv")

     petsc_options = PETSc.Options()
     petsc_options['pc_pflareinv_type'] = 'newton'
     petsc_options['pc_pflareinv_order'] = '20'
     petsc_options['pc_pflareinv_matrix_free'] = ''

     ...[e.g., KSPSolve somewhere here]
     
or via the command line: ``-pc_type pflareinv -pc_pflareinv_type newton -pc_pflareinv_order 20 -pc_pflareinv_matrix_free``.

## Reuse with PCAIR:

If solving multiple linear systems, there are several ways to reuse components of the PCAIR preconditioner to reduce setup times:

#### 1) Setup once 

In PETSc the ``KSPSetReusePreconditioner`` flag can be set to ensure the preconditioner is only setup once, even if the entries or sparsity of the underlying matrix in the KSP is changed. This can be useful in time stepping problems where the linear system (or Jacobian for non-linear problems) does not change, or if the changes are small. 

#### 2) Reuse sparsity during setup

When solving a linear system where the matrix has the same sparsity pattern as in a previous solve, PCAIR can can reuse the CF splitting, repartitioning, symbolic matrix-matrix products and resulting sparsity throughout the hierarchy during the setup. This takes more memory (typically 2-5x the storage complexity) but significantly reduces the time required in subsequent setups (10-20x). If we have a PETSc matrix $\mathbf{A}$:

in Fortran:

     call KSPGetPC(ksp, pc, ierr)
     call PCSetType(pc, PCAIR, ierr)
     
     ! Before the first setup, we tell it to 
     ! store any data we need for reuse
     call PCAIRSetReuseSparsity(pc, PETSC_TRUE, ierr)

     ! First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     call KSPSolve(ksp, b, x, ierr)
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     ! Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ! but reusing the same sparsity
     call KSPSolve(ksp, b, x, ierr)     

or in C:

     ierr = KSPGetPC(ksp, &pc);
     ierr = PCSetType(pc, PCAIR);

     // Before the first setup, we tell it to 
     // store any data we need for reuse
     ierr = PCAIRSetReuseSparsity(pc, PETSC_TRUE);

     // First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ierr = KSPSolve(ksp, b, x)
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     // Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup 
     // but reusing the same sparsity
     ierr = KSPSolve(ksp, b, x)

or in Python with petsc4py:

     pc = ksp.getPC()
     pc.setType("air")

     petsc_options = PETSc.Options()
     petsc_options['pc_air_reuse_sparsity'] = ''

     # First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ksp.solve(b,x)
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     # Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup 
     # but reusing the same sparsity
     ksp.solve(b,x)
     
or via the command line: ``-pc_type air -pc_air_reuse_sparsity``.

#### 3) Reuse sparsity and GMRES polynomial coefficients during setup with AIRG

When using AIRG in PCAIR (which is the default), in addition to reusing the sparsity in the setup, the GMRES polynomial coefficients can also be reused. This is useful if the matrix is very similar to that used in a previous solve and saves parallel reductions in the setup. Note that the GMRES polynomial coefficients are very sensitive to changes in the matrix, so this may not always give good results. To enable this we simply set another reuse flag before (or after) the first solve:

in Fortran:

     ! Before the first setup, we tell it to 
     ! store any data we need for reuse
     call PCAIRSetReuseSparsity(pc, PETSC_TRUE, ierr)

     ! Tell it to store the gmres polynomial coefficients
     call PCAIRSetReusePolyCoeffs(pc, PETSC_TRUE, ierr)        
    
     ! First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     call KSPSolve(ksp, b, x, ierr)  
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     ! Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ! but reusing sparsity & polynomial coefficients
     call KSPSolve(ksp, b, x, ierr)     

or in C:

     // Before the first setup, we tell it to 
     // store any data we need for reuse
     ierr = PCAIRSetReuseSparsity(pc, PETSC_TRUE);

     ! Tell it to store the gmres polynomial coefficients
     ierr = PCAIRSetReusePolyCoeffs(pc, PETSC_TRUE);

     // First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ierr = KSPSolve(ksp, b, x)
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     // Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     // but reusing sparsity & polynomial coefficients
     ierr = KSPSolve(ksp, b, x)

or in Python with petsc4py:

     pc = ksp.getPC()
     pc.setType("air")

     petsc_options = PETSc.Options()
     petsc_options['pc_air_reuse_sparsity'] = ''
     petsc_options['pc_air_reuse_poly_coeffs'] = ''

     # First solve - the PCAIR will be setup
     ksp.solve(b,x)
     
     ...[Modify entries in A but keep the same sparsity]

     # Second solve - the PCAIR will be setup 
     # but reusing sparsity & polynomial coefficients
     ksp.solve(b,x)

or via the command line: ``-pc_type air -pc_air_reuse_sparsity -pc_air_reuse_poly_coeffs``.

#### 4) Reuse when solving the same linear system with AIRG

Often an outer loop (e.g., eigenvalue) will require solving a series of different linear systems one after another, and then returning to the first linear system to start the loop again. If the linear systems are close enough to each other to get good performance from reusing the sparsity, but different enough from each other that reusing the GMRES polynomials coefficients from a different linear system gives poor performance, PCAIR allows the GMRES polynomial coefficients to be saved externally and then restored before a solve. 

This means we can cheaply generate the exact same preconditioner when periodically solving the same linear system. An example of this is given in ``tests/ex6f_getcoeffs.F90``, where we solve a linear system, store the resulting GMRES polynomial coefficients, reuse the sparsity to solve a different linear system, then reuse the sparsity and restore the GMRES polynomial coefficients to solve the first linear system again. We should note this type of reuse is not yet available in Python. 

## OpenMP with PCAIR

If processor agglomeration has been enabled (it is by default) and:
1) ``-pc_air_matrix_free_polys`` has not been set (default).
2) ``-pc_air_inverse_type`` is one of: power (default), arnoldi or neumann.
3) ``-pc_air_inverse_sparsity_order=1`` (default)

then OpenMP can be used to reduce the time required to assemble the fixed-sparsity polynomial inverses. The idle MPI ranks that have been left with 0 unknowns after repartitioning will be used to thread. 

The number of threads will automatically increase on lower grids with processor agglomeration. For example, if the number of active MPI ranks is halved each time processor agglomeration is triggered (``-pc_air_processor_agglom_factor 2``), then 2 threads will be used after the first processor agglomeration, with 4 threads used after the second, etc. 

This relies on a repartitioning where the MPI ranks that are made inactive are on the same node (and NUMA region), i.e., each node has fewer active MPI ranks after repartitioning (typically called an "interleaved" partitioning), rather than some nodes being full and others empty. This will depend on how the ranks are numbered by the MPI library. Good performance is also dependent on appropriate pinning of MPI ranks and OpenMP threads to hardware cores. 

Given that the time required to assemble the approximate polynomial inverses is typically small, using OpenMP often has little impact on the overall setup time. If however reuse has been enabled with PCAIR (see above), then the approximate polynomial inverse time is often the largest component of the (reused) setup time and OpenMP can help.

To build PFLARE with OpenMP, add the appropriate OpenMP compiler flag before calling make, e.g., with GNU

     export CFLAGS="-fopenmp"
     export FFLAGS="-fopenmp" 
     make

and then before running a problem with PFLARE, set the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environmental variable to be the maximum number of threads to use; typically this would be the number of hardware cores per NUMA region.

It is recommended that PFLARE be linked with unthreaded BLAS/LAPACK libraries, as there is often little gain from using threaded libraries with PFLARE and that ensures the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environmental variable is used purely to control the OpenMP described above.

## GPU support           

If PETSc has been configured with GPU support then PCPFLAREINV and PCAIR support GPUs. We recommend configuring PETSc with Kokkos and always specifying the matrix/vector types as Kokkos as this works across different GPU hardware (Nvidia, AMD, Intel). PFLARE also contains Kokkos routines to speed-up the setup/solve on GPUs. 

By default the tests run on the CPU unless the matrix/vector types are specified as those compatible with GPUs. For example, the following arguments specify that the 1D advection problem ``tests/adv_1d`` will use a 30th order GMRES polynomial applied matrix-free to solve on the CPU:

``./adv_1d -n 1000 -ksp_type richardson -pc_type pflareinv -pc_pflareinv_type arnoldi -pc_pflareinv_matrix_free -pc_pflareinv_order 30``

To run on GPUs, we set the matrix/vector types as Kokkos, which can be easily set through command line arguments. Our tests use either ``-mat_type`` and ``-vec_type``, or if set by a DM directly use ``-dm_mat_type`` and ``-dm_vec_type``.

For example, running the same problem on a single GPU with KOKKOS:

``./adv_1d -n 1000 -ksp_type richardson -pc_type pflareinv -pc_pflareinv_type arnoldi -pc_pflareinv_matrix_free -pc_pflareinv_order 30 -mat_type aijkokkos -vec_type kokkos``

Note: all our tests allow the option ``-second_solve`` which turns on two solves, the first to trigger any copies to the GPU (typically for options that have GPU setup listed as "No" above) and the second to allow accurate timing. 

Development of the setup on GPUs is ongoing, please get in touch if you would like to contribute. The main areas requiring development are:

1) Processor agglomeration - GPU libraries exist which could replace the CPU-based calls to the PETSc graph partitioners
2) GPU optimisation - There are several Kokkos routines in PFLARE which would benefit from optimisation

### Performance notes

1 - Typically we find good performance using between 1-4 million DOFs per GPU. 

2 - The processor agglomeration happens through the graph partitioners in PETSc and currently there is no GPU partitioner, hence this could be slow. The default parameters used in the processor agglomeration in PCAIR (e.g., ``-pc_air_process_eq_limit``) have also not been optimised for GPUs. You may wish to disable the processor agglomeration in parallel on GPUs (``-pc_air_processor_agglom 0``). Using heavy truncation may also help mitigate the the impact of turning off processor agglomeration on GPUs, see below.

3 - Multigrid methods on GPUs will often pin the coarse grids to the CPU, as GPUs are not very fast at the small solves that occur on coarse grids. We do not do this in PCAIR; instead we use the same approach we used in [2] to improve parallel scaling on CPUs. 

This is based around using the high-order polynomials applied matrix free as a coarse solver. For many problems GMRES polynomials in the Newton basis are stable at high order and can therefore be combined with heavy truncation of the multigrid hierarchy. We now also have an automated way to determine at what level of the multigrid hierarchy to truncate. 

For example, on a single GPU with a 2D structured grid advection problem we apply a high order (10th order) Newton polynomial matrix-free as a coarse grid solver:

``./adv_diff_2d -da_grid_x 1000 -da_grid_y 1000 -ksp_type richardson -pc_type air -pc_air_coarsest_inverse_type newton -pc_air_coarsest_matrix_free_polys -pc_air_coarsest_poly_order 10 -dm_mat_type aijkokkos -dm_vec_type kokkos``

The hierarchy in this case has 29 levels. If we turn on the auto truncation and set a very large truncation tolerance  

``./adv_diff_2d -da_grid_x 1000 -da_grid_y 1000 -ksp_type richardson -pc_type air -pc_air_coarsest_inverse_type newton -pc_air_coarsest_matrix_free_polys -pc_air_coarsest_poly_order 10 -dm_mat_type aijkokkos -dm_vec_type kokkos -pc_air_auto_truncate_start_level 1 -pc_air_auto_truncate_tol 1e-1``

we find that the 10th order polynomials are good enough coarse solvers to enable truncation of the hierarchy at level 11. This gives the same iteration count as without truncation and we see an overall speedup of ~1.47x in the solve on GPUs with this approach.

## CF splittings

The CF splittings can be called separately to PCAIR and are returned in two PETSc IS's representing the coarse and fine points. For example, to compute a PMISR DDC CF splitting of a PETSc matrix $\mathbf{A}$:

in Fortran:

     IS :: is_fine, is_coarse
     ! Threshold for a strong connection
     PetscReal :: strong_threshold = 0.5
     ! Second pass cleanup
     PetscReal :: ddc_fraction = 0.1
     ! As many steps as needed
     PetscInt :: max_luby_steps = -1
     ! PMISR DDC
     integer :: algorithm = CF_PMISR_DDC
     ! Is the matrix symmetric?
     logical :: symmetric = .FALSE.
     ...
     call compute_cf_splitting(A, &
           symmetric, &
           strong_threshold, max_luby_steps, &
           algorithm, &
           ddc_fraction, &
           is_fine, is_coarse) 

or in C (please note the slightly modified name in C):

     IS is_fine, is_coarse;
     // Threshold for a strong connection
     PetscReal strong_threshold = 0.5;
     // Second pass cleanup
     PetscReal ddc_fraction = 0.1;
     // As many steps as needed
     PetscInt max_luby_steps = -1;
     // PMISR DDC
     int algorithm = CF_PMISR_DDC;
     // Is the matrix symmetric?
     int symmetric = 0;

     compute_cf_splitting_c(&A, \
         symmetric, \
         strong_threshold, max_luby_steps, \
         algorithm, \
         ddc_fraction, \
         &is_fine, &is_coarse);

or in Python with petsc4py:

     # Threshold for a strong connection
     strong_threshold = 0.5;
     # Second pass cleanup
     ddc_fraction = 0.1;
     # As many steps as needed
     max_luby_steps = -1;
     # PMISR DDC
     algorithm = pflare.CF_PMISR_DDC;
     # Is the matrix symmetric?
     symmetric = False;

     [is_fine, is_coarse] = pflare.pflare_defs.compute_cf_splitting(A, \
           symmetric, \
           strong_threshold, max_luby_steps, \
           algorithm, \
           ddc_fraction)

## Options
